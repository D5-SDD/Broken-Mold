If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that donâ€™t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell glyph*.",
